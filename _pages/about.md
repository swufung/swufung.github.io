I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at Colorado School of Mines. I am also an affiliated faculty in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.mines.edu/). 
Prior to joining Mines, I was an Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. I received my PhD  in applied mathematics from Emory University in 2019. My research interests lie in the intersection of applied mathematics and data science. In particular, I am interested in inverse problems, optimization, optimal control, and deep learning. [Daniel McKenzie](https://danielmckenzie.github.io/) and I have a joint research group: the Mines Optimization and Deep Learning group ([MODL](https://ams.mines.edu/research/optimization-and-deep-learning/)). We have a weekly seminar; feel free to email any of us for more for futher details on this.
